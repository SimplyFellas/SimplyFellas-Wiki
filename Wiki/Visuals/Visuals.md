# Visuals

## About

While this pack maintains the same vanilla world generation, we have worked hard to make your experience look no less than outstanding. We include everything from furniture to dynamic lighting, better grass, better UI elements, more effects, and so much more. The visual enhancements in SimplyFellas transform the game's appearance while maintaining the vanilla aesthetic.
