# Accessories / Curios

Accessories and Curios are two mod systems that create additional equipment slots on your character, allowing you to equip items beyond the standard armor slots. These systems are essential for equipping items like elytra, backtanks, backpacks, necklaces, and various other accessories without sacrificing your armor or inventory space.

## About

The accessory system in SimplyFellas is built on two complementary mods: **Accessories** and **Curios API**. Together, they provide a flexible framework for additional equipment slots that mods can use to add wearable items. This system allows you to:

- Equip your elytra without removing your chestplate
- Wear backtanks and jetpacks from Create mods
- Use backpacks as wearable items
- Equip cosmetic armor pieces
- Wear necklaces, rings, and other accessories
- Use various utility items that benefit from being equipped rather than held

This system greatly enhances gameplay by allowing you to combine multiple utility and cosmetic items simultaneously, making character customization and optimization much more flexible.

## How It Works

### Accessories Mod

The Accessories mod provides a simple, lightweight accessory slot system. It's designed to be compatible with various mods and allows for easy addition of accessory slots.

### Curios API

Curios API is the more comprehensive system, providing a framework that other mods can use to add their own accessory slots. It supports multiple slot types and allows mods to define which items can go in which slots.

### Elytra Slot

The Elytra Slot mod adds a dedicated back slot specifically for elytra. This allows you to equip your elytra without using your chestplate slot, so you can fly while still wearing full armor!

### Create Integration

Create mods integrate with the accessory system to allow you to equip Create-specific items like backtanks and jetpacks from Create: Stuff & Additions in accessory slots, making them more convenient to use.
