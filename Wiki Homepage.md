## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Game Won't Start / Crashes on Launch

**Problem**: The game crashes immediately or fails to start.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Java Version**: Ensure you're using Java 17 or newer
   - Open launcher settings and verify Java path
   - Download latest Java from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) if needed

2. **Increase Memory Allocation**: Try allocating more RAM (up to 10GB)
   - Some systems need more memory for initial loading

3. **Update Graphics Drivers**: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date
   - NVIDIA: [GeForce Experience](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/geforce-experience/)
   - AMD: [AMD Software](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
   - Intel: [Intel Driver & Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

4. **Disable Shaders Temporarily**: If using shaders, try disabling them to test
   - Shaders can cause crashes on some systems

#### Low FPS / Poor Performance

**Problem**: Game runs slowly or stutters frequently.

**Solutions:**
1. **Reduce Render Distance**: Lower chunk render distance to 8-12 chunks
   - Found in Video Settings → Render Distance

2. **Disable Shaders**: Shaders significantly impact performance
   - Press ESC → Video Settings → Shaders → Off

3. **Reduce Entity Render Distance**: Lower entity render distance
   - Found in Video Settings → Entity Distance

4. **Close Background Applications**: Free up system resources
   - Close unnecessary programs and browser tabs

5. **Update Optimization Mods**: Ensure all optimization mods are up to date
   - Check launcher for modpack updates

#### Out of Memory Errors

**Problem**: Game crashes with "OutOfMemoryError" or similar messages.

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase RAM Allocation**: Allocate more memory to Minecraft
   - Try 10GB if you have 16GB+ system RAM

2. **Reduce Render Distance**: Lower chunk render distance
   - This reduces memory usage significantly

3. **Close Other Applications**: Free up system memory
   - Close browsers, Discord, and other memory-intensive apps

4. **Restart Your Computer**: Clear system memory cache
   - Sometimes a fresh restart helps

#### Mod Conflicts or Missing Features

**Problem**: Certain mods don't work or features are missing.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify Installation**: Ensure all mods downloaded correctly
   - Reinstall the modpack if needed

2. **Check Modpack Version**: Ensure you're using the latest version
   - Update through your launcher

3. **Don't Add/Remove Mods**: SimplyFellas is balanced as-is
   - Adding or removing mods can cause conflicts

#### Server Connection Issues

**Problem**: Can't connect to servers or experiencing lag.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Server Version**: Ensure server is running the same modpack version
   - Version mismatch causes connection failures

2. **Check Internet Connection**: Test your connection speed
   - SimplyFellas requires stable internet for multiplayer

3. **Server RAM**: If hosting a server, ensure it has enough RAM
   - Recommended: 8GB+ for small servers, 16GB+ for larger servers

#### World Generation Issues

**Problem**: World won't generate or generates incorrectly.

**Solutions:**
1. **Create New World**: Try creating a fresh world
   - Sometimes world files can become corrupted

2. **Check World Type**: Ensure you're using "Default" world type
   - Custom world types may conflict with structure mods

3. **Update Modpack**: Ensure you're using the latest version
   - World generation can change between versions
